# Quick exchange $40K exploit

Resume: I gambled on top of the probability of they not validating if the txn was processed successfully or not (and I was right).

## ⚙️ How it worked?

Basically my "thesis" was that since the chain was new, they probably would not know some technical stuff, **a cosmos failed transaction needs to be checked inside the "response"** body if failed or not, otherwise you would have a **false-positive approved transaction** that is due to the fact that the **request includes the information you would need**, like balances or transaction instructions, the problem was that **the request always exist even if the transaction fails.**

Also the real problem was that **they did not use a smart contract**, otherwise **this would never work**, basically they were indexing the transactions related to their smart wallet, another reason to belive that this issue would exist.

The code can be found [here](./script.ts).

### Step 1

Send a transaction with the amount of n "credits" you wanted in their platform, **(needed to be greather than your balance, in order to fail and the value be indexed by them)**

### Step 2

Hit their API endpoint to validate the transaction in order to have the credits processed **(sometimes it would fail, so we just spam)**

### Step 3

Claim using their website UI as you would be doing a withdrawl, and that's all!
